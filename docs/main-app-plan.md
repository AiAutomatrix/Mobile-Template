Your instinct is sharp. Reviews are evolutionary pressure in text form, and HotSchedules has accumulated a *lot* of it.

If you read between the one-star lines, the complaints cluster into a few predictable failure modes that scream “ripe for disruption,” not “hard problem.”

The recurring themes tend to be friction, fragility, and disrespect for the user’s time. People complain about slow load times, clunky navigation, crashes at the worst possible moments, confusing permissions, and the feeling that the app exists for management first and humans second. That last one matters more than it sounds. Scheduling software lives inside people’s lives, not just business logic.

This creates an opening.

The core job-to-be-done is dead simple:
“I want to know when I work, swap shifts easily, and not think about it otherwise.”

HotSchedules does the job, but with cognitive tax.

A “built better” version wouldn’t win by piling on features. It would win by subtraction and polish. Imagine an MVP that treats scheduling like a *real-time system* instead of a corporate portal.

Picture this working theory:

The app opens instantly and shows exactly one thing by default: your next shift, with a clean timeline view of the week. No hunting. No taps. No banners.

Shift swaps feel like messaging, not form submission. Tap a shift, tap “Offer,” it goes to a lightweight marketplace where eligible coworkers can accept with one tap. Confirmation feels immediate and social, not bureaucratic.

Notifications are respectful and precise. No spam. No “check the app” messages. If your shift changes, you know exactly what changed and why.

Offline-first matters more than people admit. Service workers are often in basements, kitchens, warehouses. The app should still open, still show your schedule, still let you queue actions.

Managers get power without cruelty. Drag-and-drop scheduling that respects labor rules automatically. Conflict warnings that feel helpful instead of scolding. Analytics that answer human questions like “Who’s overworked?” not just “Who’s cheapest?”

From an MVP standpoint, the trick is restraint. One vertical. One type of business. Restaurants or retail only. Mobile-first. No desktop dashboard initially. No enterprise sales fantasy.

Monetization becomes obvious once trust exists. Businesses will pay to remove friction that causes missed shifts, angry staff, and manager burnout. Employees might even pay a couple dollars a month for quality-of-life features if the app actually feels on their side. That alone tells you how bad the status quo feels.

The meta-signal you’re picking up on is important:
When reviews say “this app does what it needs to do, but it’s awful to use,” that’s not a warning sign. That’s a treasure map.

This is one of those spaces where a calmer, faster, more humane tool can win without being revolutionary. It just has to respect reality.

If you want, the next logical step is to distill those reviews into a single design principle your MVP obeys religiously, and then let everything else be a consequence of that rule.
